# Guided Butterfly Practice

## Introduction
Find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Take a moment to settle into this space, adjusting your posture in whatever way feels right for your body today. You might want to be fully supported lying down, or it might feel better to sit - trust what feels appropriate in this moment. There's no need to force anything - we're creating space for whatever might naturally emerge.

[30 seconds of silence]

Taking time to let your body settle in its own way...

[30 seconds of silence]

Allowing yourself to arrive fully in this space...

[30 seconds of silence]

## Stage One: Opening to Sensation

### Initial Awareness
Let your attention rest gently in your body. There's no need to focus strongly - just a soft, spacious awareness.

You might notice sensations in your belly... any sense of tightness or openness in your chest... perhaps awareness of your throat... or feelings around your heart space... Maybe you notice areas of warmth or coolness in your core... or subtle movements with your breath.

Take your time here. Something may emerge quickly, or it might take a while - there's no rush. Like waiting for your eyes to adjust to a dimly lit room, allow your internal awareness to gradually become clearer.

[30 seconds of silence]

Allowing your awareness to settle into your internal space...

[30 seconds of silence]

Taking time to notice what's present...

[30 seconds of silence]

Letting your attention rest wherever it's drawn...

[30 seconds of silence]

Creating space for whatever might emerge...

[30 seconds of silence]

### Being with What Emerges
Now, as you notice sensations, you might explore what it's like to stay with them. There might be layers to what you're experiencing - perhaps what initially feels like tension reveals subtle pulsing or movement. Maybe what starts as a simple pressure carries an emotional tone.

[30 seconds of silence]

Staying present with whatever sensations you notice...

[30 seconds of silence]

Being curious about any layers or qualities that emerge...

[30 seconds of silence]

Allowing space for sensations to be felt fully...

[30 seconds of silence]

Noticing how sensations might shift or change...

[30 seconds of silence]

Simply being with whatever is here...

[30 seconds of silence]

## Stage Two: Following Movement
Now we'll open to movement, but there's no need to make anything happen. Simply notice if there are any natural impulses to move.

Perhaps your fingers want to stretch... or your shoulders want to shift... Maybe your spine wants to flex or extend... Your neck might want to turn... Your jaw might want to soften... You might feel drawn to roll across the floor... to press your hands or feet into the ground... to crawl... to rise up into a squat or to standing... to walk or dance... to explore different levels of space...

These are just possibilities - trust whatever emerges for you. The movement might be very subtle or quite expansive. It might flow continuously or come in waves with periods of stillness. You might stay in one place or travel through the space. Your body might want to explore the ground or find its way to standing.

Take your time. You might remain in stillness for quite a while as you open your awareness to any impulses that might arise. There's no need to force movement - we're simply creating space for movement to emerge through you when and if it feels natural.

[30 seconds of silence]

Resting in stillness or movement, whatever feels true right now...

[30 seconds of silence]

Allowing any impulses to emerge in their own time...

[30 seconds of silence]

Following whatever wants to move through you...

[30 seconds of silence]

Staying present with subtle shifts or fuller movements...

[30 seconds of silence]

Trusting whatever emerges as right for you...

[30 seconds of silence]

## Stage Three: Alert Stillness
Now we'll begin to transition back to stillness. Take your time to find a position that feels right for your body in this moment. You might want to sit, or lie down, or find another way of being that allows both comfort and alert presence. Your body might want something different than when we started - trust what feels appropriate now.

[1 minute of silence]

When you notice an impulse to move, become curious about what it's like to experience that impulse fully. Rather than either acting on it or pushing it away, explore what it feels like to let the impulse exist within you. Notice its quality, its intensity, how it moves or changes.

[3 minutes of silence]

You might notice metaphors or meanings beginning to form... or find certain movements remind you of particular experiences... or discover that staying with an impulse brings up unexpected feelings or associations.

[30 seconds of silence]

Being present with the full experience of each impulse...

[30 seconds of silence]

Noticing what emerges in this space of experiencing...

[30 seconds of silence]

Allowing both sensations and any images to arise...

[30 seconds of silence]

Staying curious about whatever appears...

[30 seconds of silence]

Letting each experience be fully felt...

[30 seconds of silence]

## Stage Four: Shared Reflection
Now find a partner and decide who will speak first. Arrange yourselves so you're sitting comfortably facing each other.

For the speaker: You'll be sharing about your experience during the practice - what you noticed in your body, how sensations or impulses changed over time, any images or memories that arose, what meanings these experiences might hold for you. Take your time. There's no need to immediately fill the silence or to create a logical narrative. Rest quietly until words naturally emerge about your experience.

For the listener: Your role is to hold space with your presence. There's no need to nod, make encouraging sounds, or respond in any way unless something genuinely emerges from within you in resonance to what you're hearing. When something does resonate, take your time to feel it fully before speaking. Let there be silence between speaking and response.

We'll take about five minutes for each person to share. I'll let you know when it's time to switch roles.

[5 minutes of silence]

Now we'll transition to the second speaker. Take a moment of silence to make this transition.

[30 seconds of silence]

Second speaker, whenever you're ready, begin sharing your experience...

[5 minutes of silence]

## Closing
As we come to the end of this practice, take a moment to notice how your body feels now. What has changed in your way of being? Perhaps there's a different quality to your presence, or to how you're holding yourself.

Begin to make any movements that feel right to transition back to your usual way of being - perhaps stretching, shifting position, or taking a deeper breath. Let this transition happen in whatever way feels natural for you.

Take time to acknowledge your experience and your partner's presence. When you feel ready, you can slowly open your eyes if they've been closed, and gradually return to engaging with the space around you.
